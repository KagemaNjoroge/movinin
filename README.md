## Movin' In

Movin' In is an open-source rental property management platform built to streamline operations for real estate agencies. It offers a powerful admin panel for managing countries, locations, properties, customers, bookings, and payments‚Äîpaired with a responsive web frontend and mobile app for customer interactions.

The platform supports [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide) [payment gateways](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Payment-Gateways). If Stripe isn't available in your region, PayPal serves as a secure and convenient alternative for accepting payments.

You can deploy Movin' In with minimal effort and cost using the [Docker-based setup](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Installing-(Docker)). The platform runs efficiently on a 1GB RAM droplet, making it a great choice for both single-agency and multi-agency operations. Hosting can be as affordable as $5/month on providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets).

Movin' In supports both **single-agency** and **multi-agency** modes. Agencies have access to an admin panel to manage their properties, customers, and bookings. Each newly created agency receives an email invitation to register and access the admin interface.

The admin panel allows administrators to manage:
- Agencies  
- Properties  
- Countries & locations  
- Customers  
- Bookings & payments  

Customers can sign up via the frontend or mobile app, browse available properties based on location and date, and complete the booking and payment process seamlessly.

> Movin' In is free and open source. You can customize and deploy it yourself by following the [documentation](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki). If you‚Äôd like help with customization or deployment, feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/aelassas). My email is available on my GitHub profile (requires login).
