## Movin' In

Movin' In is a Rental Property Management Platform designed to streamline property rentals for agencies. It offers an admin panel for managing countries, locations, properties, customers, bookings, and payments along with a frontend and mobile app for customer interactions.

Movin' In integrates Stripe and PayPal [payment gateways](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Payment-Gateways). If [Stripe](https://stripe.com/global) isn't available in your country, simply check if [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide) is supported and use it as an alternative for smooth and secure payments.

With Movin' In, you can deploy your own customizable property rental marketplace at minimal cost using the [Docker-based setup](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Installing-(Docker)). The platform integrates Stripe and PayPal for secure payments and can be efficiently hosted on a 1GB RAM droplet, making it an ideal choice for single or multi-agency operations looking for a scalable and cost-effective solution. You can deploy it for under $5/month using cloud providers like [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets).
<!--
Movin' In is free and open source. You can customize it as you want and deploy it yourself by following the [documentation](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki). If you want me to customize it and deploy it for you, contact me by email. You can find my email in my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/aelassas). You need to be logged in to GitHub to view my email. I can deploy the platform to the cloud for you, configure your DNS, emailing, webmail and all related tasks.
-->
Movin' In is designed to work with multiple agencies. Agencies can manage their properties and bookings from the admin panel. Movin' In can also work with a single agency and can be used as a property rental aggregator.

From the admin panel, admins can create and manage agencies, properties, countries, locations, customers, bookings and payments.

When new agencies are created, they receive an email prompting them to create their account to access the admin panel and manage their properties, customers and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available properties based on location point and time, choose a property and complete the checkout process.
